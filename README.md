# ArcVault AI Automated Workflow

AI-powered intake, classification, enrichment, routing, and escalation workflow for ArcVault customer requests.

This project was built for the Valsoft AI Engineer Technical Assessment. It simulates an automated triage pipeline for a B2B software company receiving unstructured customer requests through email, web forms, support portals, or API/webhook-style inputs.

The workflow processes each request, classifies it with an LLM, extracts key information, routes it to the correct queue, checks whether human escalation is required, and saves a structured JSON output record.

---

## 1. What This Project Does

For every inbound customer request, the workflow produces:

- Category
- Priority
- Confidence score
- Core issue
- Extracted identifiers
- Urgency signal
- Routing destination
- Human escalation flag
- Escalation reasons
- Human-readable summary
- Final structured JSON record

The five required assessment sample inputs are included in:

```text
app/sample_data.py
````

The generated output records are saved in:

```text
outputs/processed_requests.json
```

### Main tools used

| Tool      | Purpose                                         |
| --------- | ----------------------------------------------- |
| FastAPI   | Exposes the workflow through API endpoints      |
| LangGraph | Orchestrates the multi-step workflow            |
| Groq      | Runs the LLM classification and enrichment step |
| Pydantic  | Validates structured inputs and LLM outputs     |
| Streamlit | Provides a simple demo dashboard                |
| JSON file | Stores the final structured output records      |

---

## 3. Why This Architecture

I separated the workflow into clear responsibilities:

* The **LLM** understands the unstructured customer message.
* **Pydantic** validates that the LLM output follows the expected schema.
* **LangGraph** manages the workflow steps and shared state.
* **Python rules** handle routing and escalation decisions.
* **FastAPI** exposes the workflow as a backend service.
* **Streamlit** makes the workflow easy to demonstrate visually.

This keeps the system explainable, testable, and easier to extend.

---

## 4. Workflow Steps

The LangGraph workflow follows this sequence:

```text
initialize_request
→ analyze_with_llm
→ route_request
→ evaluate_escalation
→ finalize_and_save_record
```

### Step 1 — Ingestion

A request enters the system through FastAPI, Streamlit, or the included sample data.

### Step 2 — Classification

The LLM classifies the request into one of:

* Bug Report
* Feature Request
* Billing Issue
* Technical Question
* Incident/Outage

It also assigns:

* Priority: Low, Medium, or High
* Confidence score between 0.0 and 1.0

### Step 3 — Enrichment

The LLM extracts:

* Core issue
* Account IDs
* Invoice numbers
* Error codes
* Product or integration names
* Monetary amounts
* Time references
* Affected scope
* Urgency signal
* Summary for the receiving team

### Step 4 — Routing

Routing is deterministic and handled in Python.

| Category           | Default Queue     |
| ------------------ | ----------------- |
| Bug Report         | Engineering Queue |
| Feature Request    | Product Queue     |
| Billing Issue      | Billing Queue     |
| Technical Question | IT/Security Queue |
| Incident/Outage    | Engineering Queue |

### Step 5 — Escalation

If escalation is required, the final destination becomes:

```text
Human Escalation Queue
```

Escalation happens when:

* Confidence is below `0.70`
* The request is classified as `Incident/Outage`
* The message contains service-impact language
* Multiple users or a wider team are affected
* A billing discrepancy appears greater than `$500`

Low-confidence cases are treated as fallback cases and routed to the Human Escalation Queue.

### Step 6 — Structured Output

Each processed record is saved to:

```text
outputs/processed_requests.json
```

---

## 5. Billing Escalation Note

For billing issues, I interpreted “billing error > $500” as the **difference between the charged amount and the expected amount**, not the full invoice value.

Example:

```text
Invoice charge: $1,240
Contract rate: $980
Difference: $260
```

Because the discrepancy is `$260`, the request is routed to Billing but is not escalated by amount.

This avoids over-escalating normal invoices simply because the invoice total is greater than `$500`.

## 7. Setup Instructions

### 1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/elissadiab/elissa-valsoft-assessment.git
cd elissa-arcvault-automated-workflow
```

Replace `YOUR_USERNAME` with the correct GitHub username.

---

### 2. Create a virtual environment

Windows PowerShell:

```powershell
python -m venv .venv
.\.venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
```

If PowerShell blocks activation, run:

```powershell
Set-ExecutionPolicy -ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned -Scope CurrentUser
```

Then activate again:

```powershell
.\.venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
```

---

### 3. Install dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

---

### 4. Create a `.env` file

Create a `.env` file in the project root.

```env
GROQ_API_KEY=your_groq_api_key_here
LLM_PROVIDER=groq
LLM_MODEL=llama-3.3-70b-versatile
```

Do not commit `.env` to GitHub.

---

## 8. Running the Project

The project has two parts:

1. FastAPI backend
2. Streamlit dashboard

Run them in two separate terminals.

---

### Terminal 1 — Start FastAPI

```bash
uvicorn app.main:app --reload --port 8000
```

Open the API docs:

```text
http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs
```

Health check:

```text
http://127.0.0.1:8000/health
```

Expected response:

```json
{
  "status": "ok",
  "service": "ArcVault AI Intake & Triage API"
}
```

---

### Terminal 2 — Start Streamlit

Activate the environment again:

```powershell
.\.venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
```

Run Streamlit:

```bash
streamlit run dashboard/streamlit_app.py
```

Open:

```text
http://localhost:8501
```

The Streamlit dashboard expects FastAPI to be running at:

```text
http://127.0.0.1:8000
```

---

## 9. How to Use the Demo

1. Start FastAPI.
2. Start Streamlit.
3. Open the Streamlit dashboard.
4. Click **Check API Health** in the sidebar.
5. Go to **Batch Run Samples**.
6. Click **Run All 5 Samples**.
7. Review the table and detailed records.
8. Go to **Results Dashboard**.
9. View or download the generated JSON output.

---

## 10. FastAPI Endpoints

| Method | Endpoint          | Description                      |
| ------ | ----------------- | -------------------------------- |
| GET    | `/`               | Basic welcome route              |
| GET    | `/health`         | API health check                 |
| POST   | `/triage`         | Process one custom request       |
| POST   | `/triage/samples` | Process the five sample requests |
| GET    | `/results`        | Read saved output records        |
| DELETE | `/results`        | Clear saved output records       |

Example request for `/triage`:

```json
{
  "source": "Email",
  "raw_message": "Hi, I tried logging in and keep getting a 403 error."
}
```

---

## 11. Command-Line Testing

### Test one sample request

```bash
python -c "from app.graph import process_request; from app.sample_data import SAMPLE_REQUESTS; record = process_request(SAMPLE_REQUESTS[0]); print(record.model_dump_json(indent=2))"
```

### Test all five sample requests

```bash
python -c "from app.graph import process_request; from app.sample_data import SAMPLE_REQUESTS; from app.persistence import clear_processed_records; clear_processed_records(); records = [process_request(req) for req in SAMPLE_REQUESTS]; print(f'processed {len(records)} records'); [print(r.request_id, r.category.value, r.priority.value, r.destination_queue.value, r.human_escalation_required) for r in records]"
```

Expected output shape:

```text
processed 5 records
REQ-001 Bug Report Medium Engineering Queue False
REQ-002 Feature Request Medium Product Queue False
REQ-003 Billing Issue Medium Billing Queue False
REQ-004 Technical Question Medium IT/Security Queue False
REQ-005 Incident/Outage High Human Escalation Queue True
```

---

## 12. Sample Output

Example processed record:

```json
{
  "request_id": "REQ-001",
  "source": "Email",
  "raw_message": "Hi, I tried logging in this morning and keep getting a 403 error...",
  "category": "Bug Report",
  "priority": "Medium",
  "confidence_score": 0.9,

## 13. Production Improvements

If this workflow were moved to production, I would add:

* Retry logic for failed LLM calls
* Request timeouts and fallback handling
* API authentication
* Secret management through a vault
* Structured logging and tracing
* Per-node latency monitoring
* Database persistence instead of JSON files
* Human review dashboard
* Evaluation dataset for classification accuracy
* Prompt versioning
* Integration with ticketing systems such as Jira, Zendesk, or HubSpot

---

## 14. Phase 2 Ideas

With another week, I would add:

1. **Human review dashboard** for escalated records.
2. **Google Sheets or Airtable integration** for business-friendly output review.
3. **Webhook.site mock destinations** to simulate downstream team queues.
4. **Evaluation script** to compare predictions against expected labels.
5. **Model fallback** in case Groq is unavailable.
6. **Docker support** for easier deployment and reproducibility.

---

## 15. Summary

This project demonstrates a complete AI automation workflow for customer request triage.

The core design principle is separation of responsibility:

```text
LLM → understands and structures the message
Pydantic → validates the output
LangGraph → orchestrates the workflow
Python rules → route and escalate
FastAPI → exposes the workflow as an API
Streamlit → demonstrates the workflow visually
JSON → stores the final output
```

This makes the system clear, testable, auditable, and ready for future production improvements.
